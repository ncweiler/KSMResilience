            <div class="textbox"><p>Many in Cedar Rapids, a city of 125,000 people along the banks of the Cedar River, remembered the record floods of 1993, when the river crested at 22.5 feet and caused extensive damage throughout the city.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox"><p>The city had spent years preparing to prevent such 100-year flood events, but they did not expect to face one again so soon.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox"><p>As the rains continued through May and June, 2008, local leaders began to monitor for potential flooding as the Cedar River began to rise.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox"><p>The city's years of preparations could not withstand such a monsterous "500-year" flood.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox"><p>The river flowed through 1300 city blocks, inundating the downtown business district, and displacing nearly 18,000 people.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox"><p>But when the flood waters rose too high, volunteers coordinated with medical professionals to help move patients to nearby hospitals.</p></div>
