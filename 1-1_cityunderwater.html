            <div class="textbox left"><p>In the spring of 2008, tornados, heavy rains, and flooding ravaged eastern Iowa.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>Many in Cedar Rapids, a city of 125,000 people along the banks of the Cedar River, remembered the record floods of 1993, when the river crested at 22.5 feet, causing extensive damage throughout the city.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox left"><p>They had spent years preparing to prevent such 100-year flood events, but they did not expect to face one again so soon.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>As the rains continued through May and June, 2008, and the Cedar River began to rise, local leaders began to monitor for potential flooding.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox left"><p>On June 13 the river crested at over 31 feet.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>The city's years of preparations could not withstand such a monstrous "500-year" flood.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox left"><p>The river flowed through 1300 city blocks, inundating the downtown business district, and displacing nearly 18,000 people.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>In the worst of the crisis, the people of Cedar Rapids came together to support one another and save what they could.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox left"><p>More than 1000 citizens responded to a public service announcement requesting help protecting the city's last uncontaminated water well.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>By sandbagging the area around the well, the volunteers saved the last of the city's clean water supply.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox left"><p>Unfortunately, a similar all-night volunteer effort was not able to save Mercy Hospital from flooding.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>But when the flood waters rose too high, volunteers coordinated with medical professionals to help move patients to nearby hospitals.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>Why was the community response in Cedar Rapids so powerful?</p></div>
            <div class="textbox left"><p>Many involved in the flood response suggested that relationships and skills built during the city's regular drills were an important factor.</p></div>
            <div class="textbox right"><p>These drills were not specific to floods, but were intended to mitigate possible risks at the nearby nuclear power plant.</p></div>
            <div class="textbox left"><p>While the power plant has never had an accident, these drills helped the community become more resilient in general to other types of disasters, as they discovered when the waters began to rise.</p></div>
