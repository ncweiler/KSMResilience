First off, take a deep breath! Everything is going to be OK.

Second, if you are really stuck, feel free to e-mail Nick (ncweiler@gmail.com) or John (jthompson1216@gmail.com), we promise we won't drop off the grid completely!

The KSM_Resilience directory consists of a few folders containing different parts of the exhibit:

    media - this contains all the videos, photographs and thumbnails for the different parts of the website. It is broken down by       section. WARNING: If you change the locations of these files (even renaming them or the folders that they are in), then you       have to go to every part pof the website where they are reference and make sure the path name is the same otherwise the           images will not load. 
    
        -Sections 1-4 ("1_casestudies", "2_risk", "3_planning" and "4_networks") contain the relevant images for all the                    thumbnails in those sections as well as the thumbnails on the main page that lead to those secions.
        -The Case studies have their own folders (1-1_cityunderwater, 1-2_buildingforthenextstorm, 1-3_culturesofEQresilience, and          1-4_surgingseas) which contain all of the photographs, stock images and videos for the relevant section.
        -Finally, home3.png and left_grey.png are the home and back arrow icon used in the header bar
        
        -WARNING AGAIN: Be very careful about chaning the names or locations of these images. Don't do this unless you absolutely         have to and even then make sure to update all the links on the other pages.

    unused - fairly self-explanatory, this folder contains pages that are not currently in use for the exhibit but could                        potentially come in handy in the future
    
    .git - ignore this for now. It contains information for which files don't need to be updated when the directory is downloaded            from the git server.
    
    The rest of the files in the main KSM_Resilience folder comprise the bulk of the interactive exhibit.
