            <div class="textbox left"><p>For the 8,000 Vietnamese residents of a tightly-knit community in New Orleans East, this was an opportunity to rebuild their community even stronger than before.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>Their strong sense of community and sense of hope in the face of adversity contributed to their incredible resilience as a group.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>Afterwards, the church leader and community volunteers took boats through flooded neighborhoods to check on everyone in the community.</p></div>
            <div class="textbox left"><p>Through the coordinated efforts of the community, the fatalities were limited to just a single elderly resident.</p></div>
            <div class="textbox right"><p>Since then, more than 90 percent of the Vietnamese community has returned to New Orleans East, a higher percentage than most other groups in the area.</p></div>

            <div class="textbox right"><p>When the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill destroyed the local seafood industry on which many residents relied, the community stepped up again.</p></div>
            <div class="textbox left"><p>They came together and developed a new, green aquaponics project with the surrounding community to supplement their economy while the Gulf recovered.</p></div>
